## Keypairs

### Spend Keypair

- **Type:** Ed25519 keypair
- **Purpose:** Long-term spend authority.
  - Public part $P = s·G$ can be shared so senders can derive one-time spend keys.
  - Private part $s$ is the clamped Ed25519 secret scalar derived from the 32-byte seed (not the raw seed itself). The seed also derives a `prefix` used for deterministic nonces when signing. Neither appear on-chain.

### Tweaked One-Time Spend Keypair

- **Type:** Ed25519 keypair
- **Purpose:** Unique per UTXO; used for locking and spending that output.
  - Public: $P' = P + h·G$ (computed by sender)
  - Private: $s' = (s + h) \\bmod q$ (computed by receiver); reuse the base key’s `prefix` for signing.
- **Privacy:** Unlinkable to $P$ without knowing $h$.
- **Sender:** Can compute $P'$ but not $s'$.
- **Receiver:** Can compute both from $s$ and $h$.

#### Signing with the Tweaked Key (Ed25519)

Ed25519 signatures remain standard, verifying under $P'$, by using the base key’s deterministic nonce `prefix` and the tweaked scalar `s'`:

1. From the base seed, compute `(s, prefix)` via `digest = SHA512(seed)`; clamp `digest[0..32]` to get `s`, and set `prefix = digest[32..64]`.
2. Derive `s' = (s + h) mod q` and `P' = P + h·G`.
3. For message `m`:
   - `r = H(prefix || m) mod q`, `R = r·G`
   - `k = H(encode(R) || encode(P') || m) mod q`
   - `s_sig = r + k·s' (mod q)`
4. Signature is `(encode(R), s_sig)` — a standard Ed25519 signature under public key `P'`.

Notes:
- The nonce `r` depends only on `prefix` and `m`, not on `s'`. Reusing the same `prefix` across different one-time tweaked keys is safe because `k` binds each signature to its corresponding `P'`.

### Stealth Address *(Friendly Term)*

- **Meaning:** Wallet-friendly label for the public part of a Tweaked One-Time Spend Keypair.
- **Notes:** One stealh address = one UTXO; not reused.

### Discovery Keypair

- **Type:** X25519 keypair
- **Purpose:** Enables scanning to detect relevant outputs.
  - Public: $D = d·G$ — given to senders to allow them to derive the shared secret.
  - Private: $d$ — used with sender’s ephemeral pubkey $R$ to derive the shared secret.
- **Security:** Can be given to watch-only wallets without risking spending.

## Secrets

### Discovery Secret

- **Type:** 32-byte shared secret from ECDH:
  - Sender: $T = r·D$
  - Receiver: $T = d·R$
- **Purpose:** Input for:
  - Tweak scalar $h$ for spend key derivation.
  - Key for computing the discovery tag.

### Discovery Tag

- **Formula:**

  ```text
  tag_key = HKDF-Expand(HKDF-Extract(0, discovery_secret),
                        "discovery-tag", 32)
  tag = HMAC(tag_key || sender || fv || lv || lease)
  ```

- **Purpose:** Small value in tx header that lets receiver quickly identify their outputs.

- **Privacy:** Outsiders can’t link tags without `discovery_secret`.

### Spend Secret

- **Type:** 64-byte secret encrypted via HPKE.
- **Purpose:** Contains the `spending_secret` and `nullifier_secret` used as private inputs to the ZK circuit for spending the UTXO.
- **Security:** Cannot be used to spend the UTXO without the corresponding one-time spend private key `s'`; signature verification is enforced by the smart contract.
- **Privacy:** Leakage can enable transaction graph and nullifier linkability, and may allow pre-computation of nullifiers for future spends.
